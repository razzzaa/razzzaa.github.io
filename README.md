This application is a React-based web platform created using Express.js, MySQL, and JWT for authentication, with cookie parsing for enhanced security. It features fully functioning login and register functionalities that connect to a SQL database (the MySQL file is also included). For development purposes, you will need to adjust a few settings in the server.js file and add a .env.production file with your configuration. Otherwise, the application is fully ready for deployment.

While the project is not 100% finished and was initially built using create-react-app, incorporating some older methodologies and a few inactive and buggy methods, it remains fully functional. During development, I utilized XAMPP, but you can use any other method that includes a server and database setup.

It's important to note that the application is fully operational and connected to a Google Cloud Database. For hosting, I leverage Render.com's free tier, with server instances automatically deactivated during inactive periods. Therefore, while the provided link for the deployed site is functional, the server side may be inactive due to periods of inactivity.

Feel free to explore my repository to delve into the code and functionalities of the application. Feedback is always welcome. In the future, I plan to overhaul this project from scratch using newer and much more efficient methods to showcase my progress as a developer!
